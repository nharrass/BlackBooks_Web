          <h2>Introduction-Prison Reform or Prison Abolition?</h2>
          <div class="articletext">
            In most parts of the world, it is taken for granted that whoever
            is convicted of a serious crime will be sent to prison. In
            some countries-including the United States-where capital
            punishment has not yet been abolished, a small but significant
            number of people are sentenced to death for what are
            considered especially grave crimes. Many people are familiar
            with the campaign to abolish the death penalty. In fact, it has
            already been abolished in most countries. Even the
            staunchest advocates of capital punishment acknowledge the
            fact that the death penalty faces serious challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            Few
            people find life without the death penalty difficult to imagine.
            On the other hand, the prison is considered an inevitable
            and permanent feature of our social lives. Most people are
            quite surprised to hear that the prison abolition movement
            also has a long history-one that dates back to the historical
            appearance of the prison as the main form of punishment. In
            fact, the most natural reaction is to assume that prison
            activists-even those who consciously refer to themselves as
            "antiprison activists"-are simply trying to ameliorate
            prison conditions or perhaps to reform the prison in more
            fundamental ways.
            <br />
            <br />
            In most circles prison abolition is simply
            unthinkable and implausible. Prison abolitionists are dis
            missed as utopians and idealists whose ideas are at best
            unrealistic and impracticable, and, at worst, mystifying and
            foolish. This is a measure of how difficult it is to envision a
            social order that does not rely on the threat of sequestering
            people in dreadful plaees designed to separate them from
            their communities and families. The prison is considered so
            "natural" that it is extremely hard to imagine life without it.
            It is my hope that this book will encourage readers to
            question their own assumptions about the prison. Many people
            have already reached the conclusion that the death penalty is an
            outmoded form of punishment that violates basic
            principles of human rights.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is time, I believe, to encourage
            similar conversations about the prison. During my own
            career as an antiprison activist I have seen the population of
            u.s. prisons increase with such rapidity that many people in
            black, Latino, and Native American communities now have
            a far greater chance of going to prison than of getting a decent
            education. When many young people decide to join the military
            service in order to avoid the inevitability of a stint in
            prison, it should cause us to wonder whether we should not
            try to introduce better alternatives.

            </div>
            The question of whether the prison has become an obsolete
            institution has become especially urgent in light of the
            fact that more than two million people (out of a world total
            of nine million! now inhabit U.S. prisons, jails, youth facilities,
            and immigrant detention centers. Are we willing to relegate
            ever larger numbers of people from racially oppressed
            eommunities to an isolated existence marked by authoritarian regimes,
            violence, disease, and technologies of seclusion
            that produce severe mental instability? According to a recent
            study, there may be twice as many people suffering from
            mental illness who are in jails and prisons than there are in
            all psychiatric hospitals in the United States combined.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I first became involved in antiprison activism during the
            late 1 960s, I was astounded to learn that there were
            then close to two hundred thousand people in prison. Had
            anyone told me that in three decades ten times as many people
            would be locked away in cages, I would have been
            absolutely incredulous. I imagine that I would have responded
            something like this: II As racist and undemocratic as this
            country may be [remember, during that period, the demands
            of the Civil Rights movement had not yet been consolidatedt
            I do not believe that the U.S. government will be able to
            lock up so many people without producing powerful public
            resistance. No, this will never happen, not unless this country
            plunges into fascism." That might have been my reaction thirty
            years ago.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reality is that we were called upon
            to inaugurate the twenty-first century by accepting the fact
            that two million group larger than the population
            of many countries-are living their lives in places like Sing
            Sing, Leavenworth, San Quentin, and Alderson Federal
            Reformatory for Women. The gravity of these numbers
            becomes even more apparent when we consider that the
            U.S. population in general is less than five percent of the
            world's total, whereas more than twenty percent of the
            world's combined prison population can be claimed by the
            United States. In Elliott Currie's words, "[t]he prison has
            become a looming presence in our society to an extent
            unparalleled in our history or that of any other industrial
            democracy. Short of major wars, mass incarceration has
            been the most thoroughly implemented government social
            program of our time."
            <br/>
            <br />
            In thinking about the possible obsolescence of the prison,
            we should ask how it is that so many people could end up in
            prison without major debates regarding the efficacy of
            incarceration.
